<h1 align="center">Etch-a-Sketch ðŸŽ¨</h1>

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, aimed at enhancing skills in arrays, loops and event handling by building a browser version of a sketchpad similar to an Etch-A-Sketch. It also involves DOM manipulation, handling not only HTML and events, but also CSS styles.

## Objectives

- **Develop dynamic web content:** Create a webpage with interactive elements that change in response to user actions.
- **Implement event handling:** Respond to user interactions (mouse hover, button clicks) to create visual effects and modify the etch-a-sketch behavior.
- **Implement grid layout with flexbox:** Use Flexbox to construct a grid layout, practicing CSS layout techniques.
- **Practice using JavaScript to modify CSS styles:** Use JavaScript to affect the CSS styling applied to the page.
- **Develop new features using Git branching/merging:** Create branches to work on features and, when completed, incorporate them to the main branch by merging them together.

## Features

- **Reset Button:** Resets the grid to its initial state.
